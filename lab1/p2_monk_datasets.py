Assignment 0:

MONK-2 is the hardest. This is due to the necessity of needing to check each individual case, e.g. if a1 and a2 equal 1
it still requires a tree structure that goes through a3 to a6. This is not the case for MONK-1 where a5 could be equal
to 5 and it can be determined that the sample belongs to True just after one node. While MONK-3 is more complicated than
MONK-1 it doesn't require a tree structure for each individual case like MONK-2, therefore MONK-2 is the hardest to
learn.
