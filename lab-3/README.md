Lab instructions found in *lab3.pdf*

The lab could be done in either pure python or jupyter notebook; mine was done in pure python. All code that was added can
be found in *lab3.py*. Directories *plots* and *text* was used for report *Lab 3 - Bayesian Learning and Boosting.docx*.

Forgot to enable seaborn from the start, which is why some plots aesthetics differ.
